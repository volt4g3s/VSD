# VSD (Virus Screen Death)
## DESCRIPTION
This virus is designed to take control of Android devices by exploiting administrator permissions.  Once installed, it displays a fake interface that demands access permission from the user and locks the device screen repeatedly every second.  For this reason, I recommend not installing it because this is only for learning purposes.

## KEY FEATURES
- **Screen Locking**: Upon installation, the virus locks the device's screen, preventing access to legitimate functions.
- **Administrator Permission Request**: The virus prompts the user to grant administrator privileges, which, if approved, grant full access to the device.
- **Reboot**: the process by which an application is executed automatically after undergoing a restart or manual.

## HOW IT WORKS
- **Installation**: Once the infected application is installed, the virus requests administrator permissions under various convincing pretexts.
- **Device Lockdown**: After gaining administrator access, the virus locks the device and prevents the user from accessing it normally.
- **Ransom Demands**: Some versions of the virus display messages or interfaces demanding payment to unlock the device.

## REMOVAL
If your device is infected, consider the following steps:
- **Safe Mode**: Attempt to enter safe mode and uninstall recently installed apps before the device was locked.
- **Factory Reset**: If the above step fails, consider performing a factory reset on your device (note: this will erase all data, so make sure to back up your data beforehand).
- **Professional Help**: If you're having difficulty removing the virus, seek assistance from professional service providers or software support.

## DISCLAIMER
Please note that creating, distributing, or using lock screen ransomware viruses using Android administrator privileges is illegal and against the law. This information is provided solely for educational and security awareness purposes.

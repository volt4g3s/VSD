<h1 align="center">VSD (Virus Screen Death)</h1>
This virus is designed to take control of Android devices by exploiting administrator permissions.  Once installed, it displays a fake interface that demands access permission from the user and locks the device screen repeatedly every second.  For this reason, I recommend not installing it because this is only for learning purposes.

## KEY FEATURES
- **Background**: Once installed, the virus will run in the background repeatedly locking the device screen every second, preventing access to legitimate functions.
- **Administrator Permission Request**: The virus prompts the user to grant administrator privileges, which, if approved, grant full access to the device.
- **Reboot**: The process in which the virus runs automatically after undergoing a restart or manually.

## HOW IT WORKS
- **Installation**: Once the infected application is installed, the virus will run in the background and request administrator permission under various convincing pretexts.
- **Device Lockdown**: After gaining administrator access, the virus locks the device repeatedly every second and prevents users from accessing it normally.
- **Restart**: Once the device is restarted, the virus will run automatically without having to open it.

## REMOVAL
If your device is infected, consider the following steps:
- **Safe Mode**: Attempt to enter safe mode and uninstall recently installed apps before the device was locked.
- **Factory Reset**: If the above step fails, consider performing a factory reset on your device (note: this will erase all data, so make sure to back up your data beforehand).
- **Professional Help**: If you're having difficulty removing the virus, seek assistance from professional service providers or software support.

## DISCLAIMER
Please do not install it.  Use of this application is entirely at the user's own risk.  We are not responsible for any losses or problems arising from the use of this application.
